# Game-of-Life-Round-2
The more complex version of the Game of Life Coding Challenge

The Rules(stolen from Hopson97):
The world is grid of cells, with 3 possibilities: Predator(Red), Prey(Green), or Empty(Black).

Both predator and prey have a set health, that changes over time.

The simulation works in steps, with the following rules:

-For prey:
    -Tries to move in a random direction.
    -Health increases.
    -When health reaches a threshold:
        -They will reproduce, creating a new "Prey"
        -Their health resets to 1

-For predator:
    -Tries to move in a random direction.
    -Health decreases.
    -When health reaches 0, they die and turn into "Nothing".
    -If the adjacent square is a prey:
        -They will eat it, turning it into a "predator" (reproducing)
        -Their health will increase by the amount of health the eaten prey had
